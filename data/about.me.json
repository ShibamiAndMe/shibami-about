      "text": "First of all, thanks for being here. I'm Alex and I'd like to share with you few things about me :-) I bornt in Barcelona (Spain) and I lived in MÃ¡laga, Zamora and Salamanca as well. However, my city was always Barcelona. Although I've been always writing, finally I decided study Law in the University and I became a lawyer. I spent a lot of time working on a bank and doing administrative tasks, until one day, after many struggles against my doubts and fears, I decided to study Marketing Online and Community Management and that was the best thing ever. I was closer to my goal, step by step. This year I start the adventure of my life, and I moved on to Brisbane, Australia. Here, I'm fight for my dreams every day, and that's also the reason why I'm doing this, talking to you and sharing my life and my work with you. <br><br> Creative, dreamer, nomad, sensitive, sympathetic or friendly are with no doubt some adjectives that it can describe me pretty well. Even though, I really think that it could be too brave try to describe a person with only some words. I'm feelings, I'm thoughts, I'm memories, I'm failures, I'm succeesses... All of us are. * The point of maximum danger is the point of least fear *",
